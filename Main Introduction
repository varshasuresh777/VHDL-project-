The main aim is to design an arithmetic logic unit which perform 
operation of Z = Â¼ [A * B] + 1. The arithmetic unit consists of Wallace multiplier 
where two operands which are 8-bit are multiplied and the output is 16- bit number 
is passed to the barrel shifter. The barrel shifter shifts the output by two bits and 
given to the adders. The transition of LOAD signal from HIGH TO LOW the values 
of A and B are latched to register RA and RB. The CLEAR signal is used to reset 
registers to zero. The final output is obtained at the port Z which is 16-bit register. 
The LOAD signal starts calculation and ends with END_FLAG signal.



The Wallace Tree Multiplier is implemented in this design to have less delay and 
suitable for more for the more than 16-bit operands. This multiplier can be used in 
array multiplier and booth multiplier. In Wallace multiplier implementation, two 
operands are multiplied to reduce the partial product into two row matrix with help 
of adders such as full adder, half adder and carry save adder. The each bit of every 
column of the partial products are added together in parallel where no carry is 
propagated. Then again matrix is reduced by next set to obtain two row matrix 
model.
